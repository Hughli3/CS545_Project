## Name of Project: RentStevens
 
- List of Team Members: Zheng Li, Xinyu Chen
 
Brief Description of Project (2-4 sentences):
RentStevens is a rental platform targeting Stevens students. Different from the traditional rental website, RentStevens provides more rental information for students. For example, students are more concerned about the commuting distance, deposit, and the surrounding supermarkets. Also, RentStevens could also provide students with more customized rental options. These are our assumptions. We will explore the real needs of students during the project.
